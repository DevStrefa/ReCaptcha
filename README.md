# ReCaptcha 0.1.0

Simple PHP Library, designed for verifications of Google reCaptcha. 


### Why ? 

Simple answer for this question is "I really don't know" :)  but seriously, it is very simple project ideal for learning several PHP-Development tools, and if this library could be usefull for someone else that's great.

### How to use package

[[This section is still in progress meanwhile you can look at example code]]

### Current State of Library

This code still is an early beta phase,  it's working for simple integration however it can be too simple for many purposes. In that case I really recommend Official [Google library](https://github.com/google/recaptcha)

> **Warning:** This repo is for now still backup-repo so whole structure can be changed if it'll be needed

## ToDo

 * Write Complex tests for code
 * More Senders (Curl etc.)
 * Documentation and How to use section
 * Deploy to packagist
 * Travis integration
